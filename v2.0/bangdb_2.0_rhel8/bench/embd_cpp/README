Make sure you have run the install.sh to have several soft links configured as required
and also installed the necessary libs

Build sample app
----------------

Please see getting started with client at bangdb.com/developer

However you may simply get started by building the sample app provided here

Following steps would help;

A. link with the libbangdb-embd-cpp only
B. include the headers in the include folder

that's it!
You may use following to build sample.cpp and run. This is embedded version hence it doesn't need server, simply run it

compile ....
	g++ -O3 -Wall sample.cpp -osample -I/usr/local/include/bangdb-embd -lbangdb-embd-cpp

run...
	./sample

Note: bangdb.config is required to run any app (keep in the same folder as exe)

Use the detail API and dev section at the bangdb.com

Enjoy!



BangDB Config : bangdb.config file. Keep this file in the base dir of your application

bangdb.config - using this you can set various run time config for the db. Also it provides
enough hadles with tune the core and internals of db to run in the best possible manner depending upon
the host configuration and boundaries. The config file has details before each of these paramaeters and also
structured in a manner to allow you to pick and modify things in rather confortable way
