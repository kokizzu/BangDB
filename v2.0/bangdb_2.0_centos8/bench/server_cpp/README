This is simple bench file to test the bangdb.

This may also be helpful in understanding how one can code for the BangDB, although
it covers only small part

Please go to www.bangdb.com\developer to get more info on BangDB and help
related to development of app using BangDB

Here are the steps to run the bench

Start the BangDB server, then

First, let's build the bench

> bash build.sh

// if successful, now you may run tests

> bash exapp.sh

or, to put 1M key and val using 32 threads/connections

> bash exapp kv 32 1000000 put

or, to get 1M key and val using 32 threads/connections

> bash exapp kv 32 1000000 get


Various options are;

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
usage: bangdb_bench <kv/doc/stream> <num_threads> <num_items> <put/get/scan/all/overlap> [factor(optional define only with overlap)]
       factor > 1; the factor defines how much read and write
       1/factor part write and rest read. ex; factor = 3, 33 percent write and 67 percent read
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running the default test with 16 threads (connections), put and get 1000000 items


etc...

Note: if you run direcly using bench exe, then you may need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the lib
